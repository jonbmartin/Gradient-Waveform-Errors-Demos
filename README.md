# Gradient Waveform Errors and How to Correct Them

Welcome! This is a code repository accompanying the paper "Gradient Waveform Errors and How to Correct Them: A review of methods to measure and correct for spatiotemporal magnetic field errors in MRI" (Harkins, K.D. et. al (In Prep.). All demos can be run as google colab notebooks, with no local dependencies.

## Demo 0: Characterization waveform building
Our first demo will start at the beginning: how do you characterize your gradient system? One of the most widely adopted methods is to input a known gradient waveform  with some frequency content of interest, and measure the output. 
This can be used to build a model of your hardware system. We will start by showing how to build a slew rate limited chirp, a typical gradient characterization waveform.

## Demo 1: Eddy currents and correction methods
Our second demo will simulate a system with some eddy currents, which creates a nonideal (but linear) gradient system response. We will show how to correct the eddy currents.

## Demo 2: GIRF measurement and correction
Our third demo will simulate a simple system which attenuates high frequencies (quite common). We will build a GIRF model of the system and use it to predict waveform distortions.

## Demo 3: Neural network measurement and correction
Our fourth demo will use real data from a 7T animal scanner, and train a temporal convolutional network to predict gradient waveform errors. For this demo, make sure to set the runtime to GPU.
